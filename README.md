# Healthcare Cost Estimation
I have developed a machine learning model fused with deep learning algorithms to find the cost of healthcare diagnosis in a more accurate way.
My solution is an advanced healthcare cost prediction system powered by machine learning and sophisticated analytics. It starts with gathering comprehensive dataset, incorporating historical healthcare cost data, patient profile, hospital information, and medical procedure specifics. To maintain data integrity, I meticulously pre-processed the data, addressing quality issue, correcting error, handling outlier, and imputing missing value. A key differentiator lies in my application of advanced feature engineering technique. This allows me to extract crucial insight from the data, enabling my model to capture complex relationship and pattern effectively. I encode categorical variable, normalize numerical feature, and create derived feature to ensure relevant and impactful data for my machine-learning algorithm. I employ a systematic approach to model selection and training, exploring a diverse range of algorithm, such as regression model, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network. To ensure model generalization, I split the dataset into training, validation, and testing set, fine-tuning hyperparameter to optimize performance. Transparency and explainability are core component of my solution. I incorporate state-of-the-art technique like SHAP value and LIME to provide insight into model's prediction. This foster trust among healthcare provider, insurance company, and policymaker, facilitating informed decision-making. Addressing healthcare disparity is another vital aspect of my system. Analyzing pattern across different patient group help us identify potential bias and ensure fair cost estimate for all patient, promoting inclusive and patient-centric healthcare system. My advanced machine learning-based healthcare cost prediction system offers precise and detailed forecast, optimizing resource allocation, financial planning, and decision-making for healthcare stakeholder. It empower patient with a better understanding of potential medical cost, enable hospital to manage resource effectively, assist insurance company in setting accurate premium, and provide policymaker with data-driven insight for informed choice.
